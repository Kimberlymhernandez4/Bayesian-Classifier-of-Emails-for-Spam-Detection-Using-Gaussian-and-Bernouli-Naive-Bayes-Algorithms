# Problem Domain
Email spam detection is one of the most challenging classification problems in digital communication, and can often contain fraudulent offers, malware links, or other false advertisements. This can directly impact both organizations and individuals as they use online technologies, further raising the need for efficient and accurate filtering methods. Bayesian Classification can be used to evaluate and build a predictive model that can effectively label spam emails. Using UC Irvine’s Spambase dataset, this project aims to determine whether Gaussian Naïve Bayes or Bernoulli Naïve Bayes is more effective in correctly labeling spam and non-spam emails. Bayesian methods are an effective approach to this problem domain because they perform well with limited training data and in cases with a large number of features (Geeks for Geeks, 2025). Additionally, the model is easy to implement and is computationally efficient for predictions and classification analysis.

# Objective

The main objective for this analysis is to build a model with Bayesian Classification using the Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes methods to classify spam and non-spam emails in the Spambase Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The main research question is: “Can Bayesian Classification methods effectively label spam and non-spam emails based on text-related features with great accuracy?”. Two models (Gaussian NB and Bernoulli NB) will be compared based on their performance with metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, f1-score, and the ROC/AUC curve. A secondary question that will be considered is: “ Which Naïve Bayes model is more effective, the Gaussian or Bernoulli algorithm? Based on the performance metrics, why is one model more favorable to use than the other?”
